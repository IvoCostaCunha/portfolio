## Introduction
Portfolio is the general name of the project which objective is to build a website containing my portfolio in a webpage format.

This project consists of 2 distinctive parts, the Angular frontend whose source code is contained in this repository named Portfolio and an [REST API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) named Portfolio-API.

The final objective is to have the data in the frontend fetched via [GET requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) from Portfolio-API, and also be able to edit this data via [POST requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) at the same API. These two objectives should result in a website which contents can be edited without the need of a redeployment expect on updates, a kind of light in features but also in loading times [CMS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CMS) (Content Management System).
